  <h1>Internet Explorer is harmful to the mental health of developers</h1>
  <p>
    Jokes aside, it is hard work to get even the simplest modern website to work in Internet Explorer without resorting to hacks, workarounds,
    pollyfills and outmoded development techniques because Microsoft have never kept pace with support for the open
    standards supported by other browser vendors and relied upon by developers.
