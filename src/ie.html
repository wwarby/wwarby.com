    <h1>Internet Explorer is a bad browser</h1>
    <p>
      Every version of Internet Explorer up to and including 11 is riddled with bugs and lacking in support for features
      and open standards found in every other major browser which developers rely on. It's JavaScript engine is slow,
      it's developer tools are complete shit and it's not available for Mac OS. For these reasons it is tedious and time
      consuming work to make even the simplest modern website to work in Internet Explorer without resorting to hacks,
      workarounds, pollyfills and outdated development techniques. I'm sorry if you are forced to use this terrible
      browser by your employer and cannot access the site. If this page starts showing up in my analytics with any
      regularity I might put in the effort to support Internet Explorer, but for now please consider using Chrome, Safari,
      Firefox, Edge or Opera if you have the option.
